            <div>This worldwide problem has affected more species and environments than we had ever known. Polar bears, the Arctic, and even coral triangles have been hit hard with their habitats shrinking to nothing.</div>

            <h2>What Can We Do About It?</h2>
            <div>Something big that we can at least maintain is to not increase temperatures around the world by at least 2 degrees Celsius. If the world temperature increases by more than 2 degrees Celsius, then the entire world will be warmer than usual.
            </div>
            <div>One thing we can do, is to use less energy for our homes, towns, and schools, by using solar panels. In a nutshell, solar panels convert sunlight into electrical energy that can be stored in batteries and thermal storage.</div>
